        <p>
          If you're like me, you've probably spent hours in your local pet/aquarium store,
          infatuated by all of the different species of fish. This is a (very) fun experience,
          but it can also be daunting: there are so many options out there, and information
          can be hard to come by! I can recall hundreds (if not thousands) of Google searches,
          looking up "can species A live with species B?" and "tank needs for species C?" -
          it can be a very long process, especially for someone new to the hobby altogether.
          After I finally got fed up with the endless individual searches, I decided I'd had enough.
        </p>

        <p>
          Welcome to Comparium! I built this site to answer the question I've asked myself
          over and over again: "Why isn't there a better way?" Over the past month, I've spent
          countless hours dedicated to changing that. My dream for this site is to be a place
          for all things aquarium, whether you're setting up your first fish tank or your 100th.
          Engaging with aquatic knowledge and building community should be fun and interactive,
          but it feels scattered across the innumerable online forums and groups. This site
          isn't designed to replace any of those communities that have been built, and it
          ABSOLUTELY doesn't replace your local fish shop; rather, it complements them by
          providing a dedicated space to learn and share, free from the distractions of other sites.
        </p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>An ever-growing glossary of fish species, plants, diseases, equipment, and aquarium terminology</li>
          <li>A community page to share tanks, ask questions, and converse with community members</li>
          <li>An account feature for users to save personal tanks, track inhabitants and changes (water change, maintenance, etc), and schedule events to be notified of</li>
          <li>A comparison tool for quickly checking the relative compatibility of fish species</li>
          <li>An FAQ page with common aquarium questions</li>
          <li>And more - growing by the day</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This is entirely built as a passion project, and I hope to share that passion with
          each of you. With this, I welcome feedback, suggested additions, or any other general
          questions, comments, or concerns - I can't build a great site without recognizing
          those who have much more information than I do to share. If you have a favorite fish
          that isn't on here yet, reach out! If I got something wrong (not only possible, but likely),
          let me know! I welcome any and all input to bring this vision to fruition. After all,
          if I make a website and don't include features for anybody else, what's the point?
        </p>

        <p>
          That's all I have to say for the time being. I'd love for you to check it out and
          let me know what you think.
